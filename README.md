Hello! 

This is my final project code. I used many rudimentary concepts with a touch of advanced optimization tools. While the code may not be 100% effective or useful, the core/key concepts were what really mattered to me in making this work. I hope this code is fun and beneficial to look at. I look forward to my attempt to explain it thoroughly. The directions are below.

Thank you!

Hello! Here are the following directions for the project! 

Step 1: Open both codes

Step 2: Execute the main code "security_scanner.py" 

Step 3: It will prompt you to give either number (1 or 2), you will answer with 1 for a file scan. 

Step 4: When the shell prompts you to give a file/code name you will respond with "vulnerable_code.py"

Step 5: Analyze the feedback from the code to understand the vulnerabilities better!


PS - it will save a txt document to your pc with the initial feedback/response from the scanner.
